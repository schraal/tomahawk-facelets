= How to Use =

Using this library is the simplest way to provide Facelets support to the !MyFaces Tomahawk component library.

To use it, just put the tomahawk-facelets.jar into the classpath (e.g. {{{yourApp/WEB-INF/lib}}})

== Maven ==

As of now, this library is not present in any maven repository. If you want to use it in your maven builds, just install the jar in your local repository (or in a remote repository) with the following command:

{{{
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=tomahawk-facelets.jar -DgroupId=com.google.code.tomahawk  -DartifactId=tomahaw-facelets -Dversion=1.1.6 -Dpackaging=jar
}}}

Change the file and version numbers accordingly.

Then, to use it in your builds, just include this dependency in your POMs:

{{{
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.code.tomahawk</groupId>
    <artifactId>tomahawk-facelets</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.6</version>
</dependency>
}}}
